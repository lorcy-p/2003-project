Participants : Jack, Jass, Joshua, Lorcan

 What happened:

Showed the prototype to client - model animations 
Client says that the visimes are not all correctly being displayed. Feedback for the fix has been received. Averaging the animations instead of adding them.
Talked to client about the audio input being displayed. Feedback has been received.
Client would like a background for the model - a more game environment 
Client would like suggestions for new models
Possibly add hand movements for the model when communicating
refactor code to ensure sustainability for future development
could create some more interesting models


 Tasks to complete for next sprint:

Provide suggestions for new models
Alter ui to be a more game-like environment
